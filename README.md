**HideDroid** is an Android app that allows the per-app anonymization of collected personal data according to a privacy level chosen by the user.

In a nutshell,**HideDroid** collects all the network traffic generated by the invocation of API calls belonging to analytics libraries, and extract the exported data.

Then, it anonymizes the personal and device data using a generalization technique, and the data related to the user’s behavior using an approach based on the concept of local differential privacy, in a way that preserves as much data semantics as possible.

Finally, the anonymized data are sent to the expected recipients by mimicking the original network calls.

HideDroid app has been compatible with all Android versions (also the newest ones 11 and 12) since the release [1.2](https://github.com/Mobile-IoT-Security-Lab/HideDroid/releases/tag/1.2). 
With Android versions 11 and 12, the HideDroid app requires that the user manually installs the CA certificate. Indeed, the HideDroid app generates the certificate and place it inside the SdCard storage, so the user can manually install it on its device. 
This operation is performed only for Android versions 11 and 12 due to new constraints on the programmatic installation of CA certificates, and it is performed programmatically in the other Android versions
