**HideDroid** is an Android app that allows the per-app anonymization of collected personal data according to a privacy level chosen by the user.

In a nutshell,**HideDroid** collects all the network traffic generated by the invocation of API calls belonging to analytics libraries, and extract the exported data.

Then, it anonymizes the personal and device data using a generalization technique, and the data related to the user’s behavior using an approach based on the concept of local differential privacy, in a way that preserves as much data semantics as possible.

Finally, the anonymized data are sent to the expected recipients by mimicking the original network calls.
